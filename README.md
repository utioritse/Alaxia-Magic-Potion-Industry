# Alaxia-Magic-Potion-Industry
An overview of the magic potion industry in the fantasy land of Alaxia

## Background
While looking for a small dataset to practice with, I generated one based on the industry of a fantasy land. 

## Objective
To provide a comprehensive analysis of the Alaxia potion market, highlighting sales trends, customer demographics, seasonal demand, and regional distribution. This dashboard aims to enable data-driven decisions for optimizing production, marketing strategies, and enhancing profitability across the potion industry.

## Key Insights 
- Dragon Healing Potion is the highest-selling potion across all five regions.
- Stealth potions are very popular among young people.
- The Shadowlands is the region with the most activity.
- Potion vendors only 21% of the revenue made in the industry region-wide, due to high production costs.
- Healing and Combat type potions are the most popular across all regions.
- Fire Resistance Potion has the highest average customer rating across the five regions, because who wouldn't be happy with being resistant to fire?
