# Alaxia-Magic-Potion-Industry
An overview of the magic potion industry in the fantasy land of Alaxia

## Background
While looking for a small dataset to practice with, I generated one based on the industry of a fantasy land. The dataset, provided in a CSV file, showcases potion data from five regions: Dragonspire, Enchanted Forest, Golden Hills, Mystic Falls, and the Shadowlands. The data further categorizes potions by type, main ingredient, price, production cost, seasonality, age groups, and customer ratings.

## Objective
To provide a comprehensive analysis of the Alaxia potion market, highlighting sales trends, customer demographics, seasonal demand, and regional distribution. This dashboard aims to enable data-driven decisions for optimizing production, marketing strategies, and enhancing profitability across the potion industry.

## Key Insights 
- Dragon Healing Potion is the highest-selling potion across all five regions.
- Stealth potions are very popular among young people.
- The Shadowlands is the region with the most activity.
- Potion vendors retain only 21% of the industry's revenue due to high production costs.
- Healing and Combat type potions are the most popular across all regions.
- Fire Resistance Potion has the highest average customer rating across the five regions, because who wouldn't be happy with being resistant to fire?

## Further Drilling
### Leveraging the interactive features of the dashboard, I explored deeper insights into potion sales and regional trends.
#### Fire Resistance
Making use of the region slicer, we learn Fire Resistance Potion is sold mostly in Golden Hills, which would suggest a bombardment of fire-based attacks in the region. The average rating of the potion also falls to the mid-range as frequent and consistent use by customers draws harsher criticism.

#### Dragon Breathing Potion 
The highest-selling potion in Alaxia sees its sales peak in the summer. It's a versatile potion but is mainly used for Healing, Enhancement and Combat. All these factors would suggest a lot of fighting during summer.
